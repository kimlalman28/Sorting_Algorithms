Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms
====
Sorting routines are among the most widely used and studied algorithms. Every
student should know how to implement several different kinds of sorts, and should have an
idea about how they perform, both theoretically and practically. This programming
project is designed to give the student practice in implementing and observing the
behavior of four sorts: **Insertion Sort**, **Merge Sort**, **Heap Sort**, and **Quick Sort**.
The program will display the sorted file and the time taken for each sort to sort each individual file (using a counter).

To execute program from the command line (assuming all 12 Num##.txt files are present):

		java Sorts
